 ### Questions and Answers:
 ```
 Q: Whose turn is it?
      In order to allow the client to find out whose turn it is, we also have several choices. One simple way is a boolean method
      or methods to ask if it is a particular playerâ€™s turn: Even within the above approach, we have a design choice: What
      should the methods do if called once the game is over? They could return false, or they could throw an exception; 
      either way, we ought to document this choice. Which do you prefer, and why?
      
      - Answer: The method should throws an IllegalStateException or return false when the game is over. 
      
      - I think return false is better, because we can expect that this case happens very commonly. 
        Some other handlings like try-catch could be written.
        And IllegalStateException is an unchecked Exception, which occurs at the runtime, it can lower the program efficiency.
